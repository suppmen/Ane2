                <p>I work deliberately with ceramic techniques and principles, where I do not have full control over the process, and I will be taking me more or less on the way.This creates a material expression which cannot be obtained by processing with traditional ceramic equipment or by hands.</p>
                <p> By launching experiments with a clay, a technique and a principle, transformation takes place during manufacturing, thus creating an expression and formula with a special tactility and sensitivity.</p>

                <p>The observation of the geological natural legal status of the clay and experience of selected techniques is designed to exploit the potential of the material, tools and process in a new way. Although the process is carried out by control and chaos, the process has been carefully subjected and experiments have been organized and repeated to achieve the final result. </p>

                <p>The quality of the light is explored at various stages such as liquid, plastic, dry and since hot liquid in the ceramic kit, and these qualities are developed and fine-tuned to exploit the legalities to create works that balance the deliberately created and the random. The work is experimental and moves both with and beyond the dogma about good craft. The production process both allows and limits and approaches a simulation of nature in a type of controlled geology.</p>

                <p>In the presentation of works, I often take the starting point in the history of the place and the spirit of the place to create a whole between work and space, where simple grips such as furniture and lighting create visual effects, in the desire to create a coherent narrative for the screen where the narrative has several layers. I'm trying to create a tension field where there are spaces to experience the works with both senses and intellect.
